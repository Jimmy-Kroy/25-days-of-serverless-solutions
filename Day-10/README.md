# Solution 

I developed the DealSeekerApp using an Azure timer-triggered function. This function runs every hour, as specified by the TimerTrigger parameter set to _("0 0 * * * *")_. The purpose of this time-triggered function is to search for great deals on X. To save costs (since X requires a paid API subscription), I‚Äôm utilizing a mock object to simulate returning great deals.    

In addition, I created an HTTP-triggered function called _GetDealsOfTheDay_. This function retrieves all the deals of the day, as shown below.

## The end point: [GET] /api/GetDealsOfTheDay
```
[GET] /api/GetDealsOfTheDay
```
The Json response of the _GetDealsOfTheDay_ is shown below.
```json

  }
]
``` 
For a `TimerTrigger` to work, you provide a schedule in the form of a [cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression). A cron expression is a string with 6 separate expressions which represent a given schedule via patterns. The pattern we use to represent every 5 minutes is `0 */5 * * * *`. This, in plain text, means: "When seconds is equal to 0, minutes is divisible by 5, for any hour, day of the month, month, day of the week, or year".

The deals website is generated by writing HTML content to the $web blob container. Additionally, I‚Äôve created a static website that you can find <a href="https://github.com/Jimmy-Kroy/my-first-static-web-app/tree/main/src" target="_blank">here</a>. This static website utilizes the GetDealsOfTheDay function to populate the deals.

Note that you need to configure CORS for the Azure Function so that it allows the static website script to query the `GetDealsOfTheDay` REST API. You can accomplish this by adding the static website URL to the CORS list of the `GetDealsOfTheDay` function. 

The local.settings.json looks like this:
```json
{
    "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated",
    "TableStorageClient:ConnectionString": "<< Storage Account ConnectionString >>",
    "TableStorageClient:TableName": "Deals",
    "BlobStorageClient:ConnectionString": "<< Storage Account ConnectionString >>"
  }
}
```

# Challenge 10: Timer Trigger

![A timer for shoppers](https://res.cloudinary.com/jen-looper/image/upload/v1575132447/images/challenge-10_d2nl4t.jpg)

## Daily Aggregated Deals

In Italy, children hang stockings on their fireplace so that an older woman named Befana can place their gifts inside of them. Along with the gifts, Befana also places candy or coal in each stocking based on how good they were that year.

This year has been really busy for Befana so she hired you as an assistant to help move things along faster. While Befana was shopping for candy, she lost her glasses. Her replacement glasses will arrive before the night of Epiphany, when children will be expecting their gifts. This is very unfortunate for Befana because she hasn't finished her gift shopping yet!

Befana is relying on you to finish shopping for the remaining gifts. Befana is really particular about getting a good deal on her shopping and expects you to be the same. Luckily, this is a major time of year for shoppers and deal seekers! But how do you keep track of all of these deals?Let's make a daily digest of current deals of interest!

In today's challenge, you'll create a tool that finds deals of the day from Twitter and adds them to a static web page. A Logic App is great serverless solution for this!
